# 🚢 Titanic EDA Project

This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the Titanic dataset, which is commonly used as an introductory machine learning problem.

The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, understand the relationships between features, visualize the data, and prepare it for predictive modeling. This project serves as an educational foundation for developing further machine learning skills.

---

## 📊 Key Objectives

- Load and clean the dataset
- Explore patterns between features (e.g. age, class, gender) and survival
- Visualize key insights using graphs
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Prepare the data for future machine learning modeling

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🧠 Learning Source

This project was built as part of my hands-on learning through the Udemy course:

**“Training in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science, Computer Vision, NLP, Chatbots, and AI-Powered Applications”**

This repository reflects my personal implementation and exploration based on concepts taught in the course.
